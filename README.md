## Quick Steps

- Json Data folder all file is in Raw JSON format. Go through the Metadata file,</br> it will provide you the quick information about the data.
- Use Py folder [.ipynb](https://github.com/Supriyam-Mishra/World-Bank-Electricity/tree/main/Py) to clean the JSON data and convert it into CSV format. (Use Jupiter Notebook for it.)
- After getting the cleaned CSV file, Use Sql folder's [Query.sql](https://github.com/Supriyam-Mishra/World-Bank-Electricity/blob/main/SQL/Query.sql) file to perform the aggregations.
- Copy the outputs of aggregation into [Excel File](https://github.com/Supriyam-Mishra/World-Bank-Electricity/blob/main/Dashboard.xlsx) and build an Interactive Dashboard.
